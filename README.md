# Tutor_Site
Site for private tutor 
This site must help me learn Python+Django+HTML+CSS

I will try to code site with 3-4 pages
In future i will optimize construction of this "site pattern"
First page will be main:
  It will contain happy video header if i find it
  Some buttons:  Registration, Tutors Blog, Appointment, Homework materials, Reviews page(feedback)
  
Registration:
